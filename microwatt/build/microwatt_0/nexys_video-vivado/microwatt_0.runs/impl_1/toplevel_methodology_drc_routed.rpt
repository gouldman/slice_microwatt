RTGT-1#21 Advisory
RAM retargeting possibility  
Identified 45 RAM64X1D primitives that could be retargeted to RAM64M. Retargeting will save approximately 30 memory LUTs and improve routability. These can usually be achieved using synthesis inference or XPMs. The memories are soc0/processors[0].core/dcache_0/dtlb_tags_reg_0_63_0_0,
