This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 soc0/bram.bram0/ram_0/memory_reg_bram_4 has an input control pin soc0/bram.bram0/ram_0/memory_reg_bram_4/ENBWREN (net: soc0/bram.bram0/ram_0/memory_reg_bram_2_0) which is driven by a register (soc0/dtm/request_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
